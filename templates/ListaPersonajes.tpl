      <h1>Dandy</h1>
      <img src="images/profile/ProfileDandy.jpg" class="img-rounded center-block" alt="Dandy">
      <p>Dandy is a tall man with a somewhat lanky yet athletic build (in the episode We're All Fools, So Let's All Dance,
        Baby, he was shown to be muscular underneath his shirt and jacket). He has jet-black hair, messy sideburns,
          brown eyes, black eyebrows, a slender nose, an angular face, and an X-shaped mark on his chin.
         His hair is styled into a Regent pompadour, which is his most striking feature as well as his pride and joy.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 PanelGaleria center-block" id="Galeria2">
      <h1>Scarlet</h1>
      <img src="images/profile/ProfileScarlet.jpg" class="img-rounded center-block" alt="Scarlet">
      <p>Scarlet is a slender woman, with a head of dark red hair, which is tied up.
        She sports a yellow and black dress with longs sleeves that shows part of her thigh.
        She also wears stockings that go all the way up her thigh. She has black high heels,
         and yellow rimmed glasses with blue earrings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 PanelGaleria" id="Galeria3">
      <h1>Meow</h1>
      <img src="images/profile/ProfileMeow.jpg" class="img-rounded center-block" alt="Meow">
      <p>Meow (like others of his race) resembles a cat, with large yellow eyes and a tan fur covered body.
         His hands, feet, belly, and the tip of his tail are grey and he has a streak of brown fur that looks like a shooting
          star running from his scalp down to his back. He sports a red cap,
        a light green garment he says is a sarong, a brown satchel he uses to carry his phone, and a pair of orange nursing Crocs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 PanelGaleria" id="Galeria4">
      <h1>QT</h1>
      <img src="images/profile/ProfileQT.jpg" class="img-rounded center-block" alt="QT">
      <p>QT is a robot on the Aloha Oe. Dandy was looking for a capable robot in the shop but ended up with QT.
        He states he is a high-powered machine though this is obviously a lie as he is very outdated.
        One example of this is that he has to recharge
        when using too much energy and has to look at the alien dictionary for information on new species.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 PanelGaleria" id="Galeria5">
      <h1>Adelie</h1>
      <img src="images/profile/ProfileAdelie.jpg" class="img-rounded center-block" alt="Adelie">
      <p>Planet Humbolt. Originally hunting her kind for a whopping 8 million woolong reward, Dandy takes a shine to her
        (and vice versa) and tries to put her in contact with nto a distinctive bun with her fringe brushed forward.
         Another notable feature are her peculiar green eyes, which have slit eye pupils. She wears a pink and white collar
         and hat combo in which her antennae protrude from.</p>
